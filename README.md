The purpose of Antergos is to provide a modern, elegant, and powerful operating system based on one of the best Linux distributions available, Arch Linux. Users need not be linux experts nor developers in order to use Antergos. From long-time linux users to linux users of only a few months, Antergos is for everyone.

The Antergos Project was originally started under the name Cinnarch, and provided only one desktop environment. Today, Antergos supports multiple desktops allowing users to select their favorite during installation.
